logi-command module for Factorio
==============================

A /logi command to import and export logistic requests, to blueprints.
Admins can use it on other players.

Intended for scenarios, especially weekly reset maps. The license is
free, and the main file can be copied into any scenario to add the
feature. (You don't have to ask. Just copy it. The more scenarios that
use it, the more convenient for everyone.)

You may want to wait a week before using it in multiplayer. I tested it, 
and it uses pcall so it shouldn't be able to crash anything, but 
it's still new.

Works as a standalone mod, although I don't intend this except for
trying it out. [Auto Trash](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AutoTrash) has
the same feature -- through a UI not a command, but the same feature --
and I made the blueprints compatible so you can use Auto Trash instead.
If you want to prepare a blueprint in single-player to use in a
scenario, you can use Auto Trash to make it.
